Dr. {physician} requested a medical physics consultation for {patient_details} for a gated, {breast_side}-sided DIBH treatment. Dr. {physician} has elected to treat the {treatment_site} with a DIBH technique to reduce dose to the heart and lung and minimize breathing motion during radiation delivery using the C-RAD positioning and gating system in conjunction with the {machine} linear accelerator.

Days before the initial radiation delivery, the patient was simulated in the treatment position (head-first supine) using a {immobilization_device} to aid in immobilization and localization. The patient was provided instructions and coached to reproducibly hold their breath. Using the {scanning_system} surface scanning system, a free breathing and breath hold signal trace was established. The patient was then asked to reproduce the breath hold pattern using visual goggles. Once the patient established a consistent breathing pattern, a gating baseline and gating window was established. Doing so, a DIBH CT simulation scan was then acquired. The DIBH CT simulation scan was approved by the Radiation Oncologist, Dr. {physician}. 

A radiation treatment plan was developed on the DIBH CT simulation to deliver a prescribed dose of {dose} Gy in {fractions} fractions to the {treatment_site}. The delivery of the DIBH gating technique on the linear accelerator will be performed using the C-RAD CatalystHD. The CatalystHD will be used to position the patient, monitor intra-fraction motion, and gate the beam delivery. Verification of the patient position will be validated with a DIBH kV-CBCT. Treatment plan calculations and delivery procedures were reviewed and approved by the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. {physician} and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. {physicist}.
